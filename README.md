# Project Name: wiki_scraper

## Description:
The "wiki_scraper.py" script is a tool designed to scrape data from Wikipedia pages, specifically focusing on extracting information from the "List of highest-grossing films" page. The script utilizes the requests library to fetch the webpage content and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML structure to extract relevant data.

## How to Use:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Import the necessary libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.
3. Define the URL of the Wikipedia page you want to scrape.
4. Run the script to extract movie titles and gross earnings data from the table on the specified Wikipedia page.
5. The script creates a Pandas DataFrame with columns for "Title" and "Gross" to store the extracted data.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- requests library
- BeautifulSoup library
